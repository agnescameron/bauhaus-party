Zach Lieberman will lead a workshop on kinetic costume. In this workshop simple body tracking will be used to create a series of costumes based on body movements.  A small framework of code examples in openframeworks will be prepared and we'll work together to look at ways of using code to extend and abstract the human form.  Some approaches require little to no coding -- we can use elements such as cut paper, drawing, etc, while other costumes we work on may require some familiarity with basic coding / P5 / OF
